# Funsters
Pineapples take vacations on people’s pizzas, they don’t care whether or not you like them , if they’re tired after a period of intensive work, they will hop right onto your piece of baked, supposedly Italian dough. 

Be like pineapples.

-Blue Three

Welcome to the section of my hub dedicated to a very important part of life - the art, science, and philosophy of having fun.
Currently this space is pretty empty, save for this short blurb you are reading, but interesting things are sure to pop up into existence in the future. Stay tuned~
(By the way, that quote at the very top, it was all made up. The only relation Blue Three has to the martial artist/movie star is the similarity in the phenonology of their names, and maaaybe a love for aphorisms.)
